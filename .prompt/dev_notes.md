Step 1: Create the Empployee Class (Business Logic)
Copilot Response: The Employee class has been created in employee.py with private attributes, getters/setters, and all specified validation rules. Each method and property includes docstrings for clarity. Let me know if you want to see usage examples or add tests.
Copilot Results: Copilot generated the full employee class. The only thing that Copilot didn't include was the "str", or type hints to the parameters, so I added those. 

Step 2: Add Read-Only and Formatting Rules 
Copilot Response: Hereâ€™s what was changed in the Employee class - The employee ID is now read-only after creation. You can set it only during initialization; there is no setter for id anymore.The phone number is now formatted as (XXX)XXX-XXXX when accessed via the phNumber property, instead of returning the raw digits.
Copilot Results: Copulot got the read-only attributes for Employee ID correct. Also, the phone number is in the correct format. I asked for further clarification on this to make sure it was correct, and the variable raw is used to store the unformatted phone number string, making it easier to display formatted but keeping the original value unchanged (stored as digits). However, I did chanange the variable name from raw to rawPhNumber because it made more sense to me. 

Step 3: Build CSV Load and Save Functions 
Copilot Response: Python functions to load and save a list of Employee objects from a CSV file named employee_data.csv have been added. The CSV columns are id, fname, lname, department, and phNumber. The loader reads these columns and creates Employee objects; the saver writes the attributes (with the raw phone number) back to the CSV. Let me know if you want usage examples or tests!
Copilot Results: Copilot gave employees = [], which creates an empty list. However, I think it should be List[Employee] = [] instead, because it makes it clear that the list should only contain Employee objects using type hints. Also it didn't create a variable with CSV_FIle = csv file where employee data is stored but rather called it in both the load and save functions, so I added this manually for simplicity and clarification. 
Step 4: Add Create, Edit, Delete Functions 
Copilot Response: add_employee-> adds a new Employee to the list and saves to CSV. Raises an error if the ID already exists. Edit_employee -> edits an exisiting Employee (except ID) by index, with validation and error handling. delete_employee -> deletes and Employee by index and saves to CSV and raises and error if the index is invalid. 
Copilot Results: Copilot created a add_emplopyee instead of create_emplopyee function, so I had to manually change that. 

Step 5: Build Display Function 
Copilot Response: Added a function print_employees that prints a numbered list of employees in the format -> 1.ID - Last, First - Department - Phone. You can now call print_employees(employees) to display employee list as requested
Copilot Results: I had to change the name of the function from print_employees to display_functions according to the expected outcome.  Howevever, it was an a neatly formatted output. 

Step 6: Build a CLI Menu (User Interface)
Copilot Response: THe main loop was added to the main employee.py file but was not added to an EmployeeApp.py file with a menu-driven CLI program. 
Copilot Results: The Copilot didn't put validation in the UI code, but rather the validation logic already present in the Employee class. However, I did create a seperate EmployeeApp.py to put the menu-driven CLI program wiht the business logic still living in employee.py. 

Step 7: Test Valid and Invalid Data 
Copilot Response: Test code has been added to the bottom of employee.py that will try to create Employee objects with both valid and invalid data and log successes adn errors to employee_test.log
Copilot Results: It put import logging in the main function instead of having it at the top with the rest of the imports so I edited that. I tested the valid/invalid employee test by running the test and it provided the correct data.
