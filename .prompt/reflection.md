I used AI coding assistants, primarily GitHub Copilot, to create the Employee Management system using MVC architecture, so it's professional, modular, and expandable. The Employee Management System ensures employee data follows structured rules, allowing HR staff to add, edit, and display employees. 
AI produced strong results in structural code, including the data layer (employee.py), which generated the Employee and Manager subclasses with @property decorators, validation rules, and inheritance and polymorphism structure. Additionally, it correctly enforced a read-only ID, formatted phone numbers for display, and created a Manager subclass using the Employee parent class. In the data layer (EmployeeData.py), it generated functional load_employees and save_employees functions that correctly listed and saved the list of Employee or manager objects to the CSV file employee_data.csv. The view layer (EmployeeView.py) correctly handled input and output, with no business rules required in the displaying functions. The controller layer (EmployeeApp.py) implemented menu options that followed the MVC pattern, handling errors gracefully, providing clear messages, and ensuring the controller can handle both Employee and Manager objects, demonstrating polymorphism.
While AI provided a good structure and generated most code correctly, there were things I had to fix and guide more carefully. For example, I had to add substrings, type hints, naming consistency, validation alignment, and polymorphism. While these weren’t necessarily incorrect, they didn’t fully satisfy the system's requirements. They needed more clarification, not only to improve my understanding of the code but also to make it more useful to HR management in understanding the coding system. When comparing AI to writing everything manually, it was definitely more efficient and saved significant time by generating repetitive property patterns, menu structures, and naming constants for clarity and maintainability. However, it did struggle with the validation rules and polymorphism, which I had to update to ensure the logic was running correctly manually. For example, it overrode a __str__ in Manager without ensuring the base Employee had a __str__, displaying AI’s struggle with polymorphism clarity. 
I would say that by using boilerplate code instead of complex logic, I saved around 8 hours. This is a significant advantage of where AI provides the most return on investment, as it significantly decreases the time spent on code creation, allowing for a greater focus on understanding the code. More specifically, by editing and debugging the AI output, I strengthened my own understanding of OOP and MVC. There are potential risks involved in relying heavily on AI< such as the risk of possible exposure of sensitive data leading to numerous security concerns, errors, and inconsistencies in code quality and maintainability, as sometimes AI introduces unnatural patterns. However, to mitigate these risks, ensuring human interventions is critical, as in my case, utilizing these AI tools proved to be very beneficial in developing the Employee Management System. 
AI supported the overall project in the process of building the system, and was a good fit for future software projects moving forward. It provided a strong return on investment on boilerplate code, enforced consistency, and streamlined the coding process. Although human oversight is critical in future software projects moving forward, it is necessary to ensure risk reduction and errors that occur when AI struggles to comprehend certain concepts.
