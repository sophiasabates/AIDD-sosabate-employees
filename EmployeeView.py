    Coordinate the Model, Data, and View 
    -> Implement menu options for: 
        -> Create (validate input, save new employee)
        -> Edit (update employee attributes, but not ID)
        -> Delete (remove an employee)
        -> Display (list all employees)
        -> Quit 
    -> Hanlde errors gracefully and provide clear messages 
    -> Ensure the controller can handle both Employee and Manager objects (demonstrating polymorphism)
